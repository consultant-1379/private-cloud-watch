use ssh-transport to establish a session with a remote host:

    ssh-transport user@host[:port]

the host key must already be present in ~/.ssh/known_hosts;
only password authentication is supported.  send a SIGINT
(ctrl-c) to close.

to get a shell:

    ssh-client host

if transport sessions are timing out, try a keep-alive:

    ssh-client-keep-alive host [secs]

sends the 'date' command on a schedule (default every 60 seconds).
