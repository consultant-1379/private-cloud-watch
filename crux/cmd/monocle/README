# Placing this in the crux/cmd hierarchy, though it will likely get relocated later as it isn't a typical fulcrum cmd.

# The swagger-server allows REST style access to monocle grpc calls.  To see it in action, start the servers and request the "ping" subsystem for a Monocle dump.

# Example test:

Run the two servers in this directory in separate windows, or in
background. Then use curl to interrogate the REST gateway to the grpc
functionality.

Window1:
